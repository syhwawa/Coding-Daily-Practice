## Problem Statement #
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.


```Python
def dutch_flag_sort(arr):
  arr.sort()
  result = [i for i in arr]
  return result
```


```Python
def dutch_flag_sort(arr):
  # all elements < low are 0, and all elements > high are 2
  # all elements from >= low < i are 1
  low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
  i = 0
  while(i <= high):
    if arr[i] == 0:
      arr[i], arr[low] = arr[low], arr[i]
      # increment 'i' and 'low'
      i += 1
      low += 1
    elif arr[i] == 1:
      i += 1
    else:  # the case for arr[i] == 2
      arr[i], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i]
      # decrement 'high' only, after the swap the number at index 'i' could be 0, 1 or 2
      high -= 1
```

## Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) as we are iterating the input array only once.

## Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1)O(1).
