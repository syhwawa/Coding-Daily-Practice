## Problem Statement #
Given an array arr of unsorted numbers and a target sum, count all triplets in it such that arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] < target 
where i, j, and k are three different indices. Write a function to return the count of such triplets.

Example 1:

Input: [-1, 0, 2, 3], target=3 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two triplets whose sum is less than the target: [-1, 0, 3], [-1, 0, 2]
Example 2:

Input: [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], target=5 
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four triplets whose sum is less than the target: 
   [-1, 1, 4], [-1, 1, 3], [-1, 1, 2], [-1, 2, 3]
   
```Python
def triplet_with_smaller_sum(arr, target):
    arr.sort()
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        left = i + 1
        right = len(arr) - 1
        while right > left:
            target_diff = target - arr[i] - arr[left] - arr[right]
            if target_diff > 0:
                count += right - left
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    
    return count
```

## Time complexity #
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(N竏様ogN). The searchPair() will take O(N)O(N). So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2)O(N竏様ogN+N2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2)O(N2).

## Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.


Similar Problems #
Problem: Write a function to return the list of all such triplets instead of the count. How will the time complexity change in this case

```Python
def helper(arr, target):
    arr.sort()
    res = []
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        left = i + 1
        right = len(arr) - 1
        while right > left:
            target_diff = target - arr[i] - arr[left] - arr[right]
            if target_diff > 0:
                for j in range(right, left, -1):
                    res.append([arr[i], arr[left], arr[j]])
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
    
    return res

arr = [-1, 4, 2, 1, 3]
target= 5
helper(arr, target)
```

## Time complexity #
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(N竏様ogN). The searchPair(), in this case, will take O(N^2)O(N2); the main while loop will run in O(N)O(N) but the nested for loop can also take O(N)O(N) - this will happen when the target sum is bigger than every triplet in the array.

So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^3)O(N竏様ogN+N3), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^3)O(N3).

## Space complexity #
Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) which is required for sorting.
