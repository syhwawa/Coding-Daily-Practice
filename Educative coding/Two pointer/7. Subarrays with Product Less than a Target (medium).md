## Problem Statement #
Given an array with positive numbers and a target number, find all of its contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target number.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target=30 
Output: [2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]
Explanation: There are six contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
Example 2:

Input: [8, 2, 6, 5], target=50 
Output: [8], [2], [8, 2], [6], [2, 6], [5], [6, 5] 
Explanation: There are seven contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.

```Python
from collections import deque


def find_subarrays(arr, target):
  result = []
  product = 1
  left = 0
  for right in range(len(arr)):
    product *= arr[right]
    while (product >= target and left < len(arr)):
      product /= arr[left]
      left += 1
    # since the product of all numbers from left to right is less than the target therefore,
    # all subarrays from left to right will have a product less than the target too; to avoid
    # duplicates, we will start with a subarray containing only arr[right] and then extend it
    temp_list = deque()
    for i in range(right, left-1, -1):
      temp_list.appendleft(arr[i])
  
```

## Time complexity #
The main for-loop managing the sliding window takes O(N)O(N) but creating subarrays can take up to O(N^2)O(N2) in the worst case. Therefore overall, our algorithm will take O(N^3)O(N3).

## Space complexity #
Ignoring the space required for the output list, the algorithm runs in O(N)O(N) space which is used for the temp list.
