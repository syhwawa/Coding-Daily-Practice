# Problem Statement #
Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

You can start with any tree, but you can’t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.

```Python
def fruits_into_baskets(fruits):
  window_start = 0
  max_length = 0
  fruit_frequency = {}

  # try to extend the range [window_start, window_end]
  for window_end in range(len(fruits)):
    right_fruit = fruits[window_end]
    if right_fruit not in fruit_frequency:
      fruit_frequency[right_fruit] = 0
    fruit_frequency[right_fruit] += 1

    # shrink the sliding window, until we are left with '2' fruits in the fruit frequency dictionary
    while len(fruit_frequency) > 2:
      left_fruit = fruits[window_start]
      fruit_frequency[left_fruit] -= 1
      if fruit_frequency[left_fruit] == 0:
        del fruit_frequency[left_fruit]
      window_start += 1  # shrink the window
    max_length = max(max_length, window_end-window_start + 1)
  return max_length


def main():
  print("Maximum number of fruits: " + str(fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'])))
  print("Maximum number of fruits: " + str(fruits_into_baskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C'])))


main()
```

## Time Complexity 
The above algorithm’s time complexity will be O(N)O(N), where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input array. The outer for loop runs for all characters, and the inner while loop processes each character only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N)O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N)O(N).
## Space Complexity 
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1)O(1) as there can be a maximum of three types of fruits stored in the frequency map.
