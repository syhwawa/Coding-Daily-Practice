Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

'Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL'
'Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL'
Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

Solution 1:
```Python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        #Iteratively
        pre = None
        cur = head
        
        while cur:
            #Save the the next
            temp = cur.next
            # point the cur to pre
            cur.next = pre
            #move forward
            pre = cur
            cur = temp
        
        return pre

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        #The recursive termination condition is that the current node is null, or the next node is null
        if head == None or head.next == None:
            return head
        #cur is the last node in the linked list
        cur = self.reverseList(head.next)
        # 5-> 4         
        head.next.next = head
        # Prevent list loops,
        head.next = None
        
        return cu
