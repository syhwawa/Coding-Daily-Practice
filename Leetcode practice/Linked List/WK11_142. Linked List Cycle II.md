Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

```Python
Solution 1:
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        #给定一个链表，返回链表开始入环的第一个节点。 如果链表无环，则返回 null。
        #哈希表
        lookUp = set()
        cur = head
        while cur :
            lookUp.add(cur)
            if cur.next in lookUp:
                return cur.next
            cur = cur.next
        return None 

Solution 2:
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        fast = head
        slow = head
        
        #if there is cycle, when fast met slow, fast = 2 *slow 
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            
            '''Let assume the distance between head and entry of cycle is a, entry of cycle to the first
            meeting point is b, the distance between the meeting point to the entry of cycle is c,we know a +
            b = a +b+c+b, so a= c. Let two pointes start from head and slow position respectively, the meeting             point will be the entry of the cycle 
            
            '''
            if fast == slow:
                fast = head
                while fast != slow:
                    fast = fast.next
                    slow = slow.next
                return slow
           
        return None
