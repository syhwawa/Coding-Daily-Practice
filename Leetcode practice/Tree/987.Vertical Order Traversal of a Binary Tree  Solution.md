Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).

Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

 

Example 1:



Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
Example 2:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
 

Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 0 and 1000.

```Python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
        #DFS获取每个元素的深度和列值，保存在哈希表，列作为key，值和深度作为value。
        hashmap = {}
        def dfs(node, x, y):
            if not node:
                return 
            if x not in hashmap:
                hashmap[x] = {node.val:y}
            else:
                hashmap[x][node.val] = y
            dfs(node.left, x - 1, y + 1)
            dfs(node.right, x + 1, y + 1)
        dfs (root, 0, 0)

        for i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] = sorted(hashmap[i], key=lambda c:[hashmap[i][c], [c]]) #排序按深度和值的大小排序，最后按列值顺序输出。

        keys = sorted(hashmap.keys())

        return [hashmap[i] for i in keys]
   ```
