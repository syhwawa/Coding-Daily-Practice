Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

```Python
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 ```
 
 Solution 1:
 
```Python 
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:        
        def helper(left, right):
            if left > right:
                return None

            # always choose left middle node as a root
            p = (left + right) // 2

            # inorder traversal: left -> node -> right
            root = TreeNode(nums[p])
            root.left = helper(left, p - 1)
            root.right = helper(p + 1, right)
            return root
        
        return helper(0, len(nums) - 1)
  ```
