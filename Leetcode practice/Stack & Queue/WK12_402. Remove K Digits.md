Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
```

```Python
Solution 1:
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        # The idea of this question is using helper stack. The left num can be drop when the num is  larger           than it, eg 1 -> 4 -> 3, drop 4. 
        
        if len(num) == k:
            return '0'
        
        stack = []
        for char in num:
            while stack and k > 0 and char < stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(char)
        
        #after tranversion, if k > 0, remove the rest of char at the ending of the stack
        while k:
            stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            
        return ''.join(stack).lstrip('0') or '0'
        
        
Solution 2:
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        # The idea of this question is using helper stack. The left num can be drop when the num is  larger           than it, eg 1 -> 4 -> 3, drop 4. 
        
        if len(num) == k:
            return '0'
        
        stack = []
        remianed = len(num) - k
        for char in num:
            while stack and k > 0 and char < stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(char)

        return ''.join(stack[:remianed]).lstrip('0') or '0'
```
