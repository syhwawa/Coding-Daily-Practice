Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
Example 3:

Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
Example 4:

Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?



class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        newS = []
        newT = []

        for i in S:
            if i != '#':
                newS.append(i)
            if i == '#' and newS:
                newS.pop()
            

        for j in T:
            if j != '#':
                newT.append(j)
            if j == '#' and newT:
                newT.pop()
            
        return newS == newT
