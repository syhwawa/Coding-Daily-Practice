Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

`Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]`
`Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]`

A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

```Python
Solution 1:
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """

        res = [0] * 3
        #The first iteration is use to counting 1,2,3
        for i in nums:
            res[i] += 1
            
        #The second iteration is use to overwitre the array with 0, 1, 2
        i = 0
        for m in range(3):
            for n in range(res[m]):
                nums[i] = m
                i += 1
 Solution 2:      
 class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        left, cur, right  = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
        #Three pointers: 
        #if current element is 0, exchange with left; move left and current one step, if current element is 2, exchange with right, move a step backward 
        while right >= cur:
            if nums[cur] == 0:
                nums[cur], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[cur]
                cur += 1
                left += 1
            elif nums[cur] == 1:
                cur += 1
            else:
                nums[cur], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[cur]
                right -= 1
   ```
