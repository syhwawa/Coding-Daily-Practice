Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Solution:
class Solution:
    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        hashtable = {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in hashtable and hashtable[s[i]] != t[i]:
                return False
            if s[i] not in hashtable and t[i] in hashtable.values():
                return False
            hashtable[s[i]]= t[i]
        return True
