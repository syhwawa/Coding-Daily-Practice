Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?

            return False
        
        for char in s:

            else:
                Counter[char] += 1
        
        for char in t:
            if char in Counter:
                Counter[char] -= 1
            else:
                return False
        
        for i in Counter.values():
            if i != 0:
                return False
        
        return True
