Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

 

Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0

木桶原理，只需要统计每个数字出现个数即可。

```Python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        count_list = [0] * 101
        count = j = 0
        for i in heights:
            count_list[i] += 1
            
        for i in range(1,101):
            while count_list[i]:
                if heights[j] != i:
                    count += 1
                j += 1
                count_list[i] -= 1
        
        return count
```
间复杂度：O(n)O(n) ，计数过程为 O(n)O(n)，比较过程外层循环次数固定为 100，里层循环一共也只会执行 nn 次，O(100+n)O(100+n)，即 O(n)O(n)
空间复杂度：O(1)O(1) ，其中一个固定长度的计数数组与一个统计变量，与输入 NN 的大小无


```Python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        sort_heights = sorted(heights)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if heights[i] != sort_heights[i]:
                count += 1    
        return count 
        
```

就sort排序至少也要O(nlogn)，后面又是一个O(n)
O(1)
