On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degress to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.


Example 1:

Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Example 2:

Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.

```
Solution:
Try to prove with math representation:
Let's say the robot starts with facing up. It moves [dx, dy] by executing the instructions once.
If the robot starts with facing
right, it moves [dy, -dx];
left, it moves [-dy, dx];
down, it moves [-dx, -dy]

If the robot faces right (clockwise 90 degree) after executing the instructions once,
the direction sequence of executing the instructions repeatedly will be up -> right -> down -> left -> up
The resulting move is [dx, dy] + [dy, -dx] + [-dx, -dy] + [-dy, dx] = [0, 0] (back to the original starting point)

All other possible direction sequences:
up -> left -> down -> right -> up. The resulting move is [dx, dy] + [-dy, dx] + [-dx, -dy] + [dy, -dx] = [0, 0]
up -> down -> up. The resulting move is [dx, dy] + [-dx, -dy] = [0, 0]
up -> up. The resulting move is [dx, dy]
```
```Python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        x, y = 0, 0
        dx, dy = 0, 1
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                x += dx
                y += dy
            elif instruction == 'L':
                dx, dy = -dy, dx
            else:
                dx, dy = dy, -dx
        return (x, y) == (0, 0) or (dx, dy) != (0,1)
```
