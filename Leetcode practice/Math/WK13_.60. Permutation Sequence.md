The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:

Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314

```Python
import math

    def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:

        arr = [str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
        res = ''
        k = k - 1
        
        while n > 0:
            n -= 1
            a, k = divmod(k, math.factorial(n))
            res += arr.pop(a)
        
        return res
```
