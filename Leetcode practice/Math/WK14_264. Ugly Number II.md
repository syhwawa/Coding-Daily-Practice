Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Note:  

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.

```Python


class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_nums = min(dp[i2] * 2, dp[i3] * 3, dp[i5] * 5)
            dp[i] = min_nums
            # 找出哪个指针对应的数造出了现在这个最小值，将指针前移一位

            if dp[i2]*2 == min_nums:
                i2 += 1
            if dp[i3]*3 == min_nums:
                i3 += 1
            if dp[i5]*5 == min_nums:
                i5 += 1
                
        return dp[-1]
```
