There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
 
Example 2:

Input: 
[[1,1,0],
 [1,1,1],
 [0,1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.
```

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 200
M[i][i] == 1
M[i][j] == M[j][i]

BFS
遍历每个人，如果这个人之前没有访问过，说明有多一个新的朋友圈，答案记录加一 就从这个点作为起点 做一次BFS，找出所有的直接朋友与间接朋友，并把他们标记访问。
BFS流程
将起点压入队列，标记访问
取出队首，从队首向外找朋友，看都能扩展到哪些还没访问的朋友，压入队列并标记访问
重复执行上一步，直到队列为空
