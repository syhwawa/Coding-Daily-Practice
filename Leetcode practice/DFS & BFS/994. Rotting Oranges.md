In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.


```
Example 1:
Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
Example 3:

Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.

                    queue.append((i + di, j + dj, time + 1))
        # if there are still fresh oranges, return -1
        for row in grid:
            if 1 in row: return -1

        return time
