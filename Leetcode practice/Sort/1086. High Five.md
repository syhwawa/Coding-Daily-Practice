Given a list of scores of different students, return the average score of each student's top five scores in the order of each student's id.

Each entry items[i] has items[i][0] the student's id, and items[i][1] the student's score.  The average score is calculated using integer division.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
Explanation: 
The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
 
Note:
1 <= items.length <= 1000
items[i].length == 2
The IDs of the students is between 1 to 1000
The score of the students is between 1 to 100
For each student, there are at least 5 scores

```Python
class Solution:
    def highFive(self, items):
        #sort the array in reverse range using sort function
        #[[2, 100], [2, 97], [2, 93], [2, 77], [2, 76], [1, 100], [1, 92], [1, 91], [1, 87], [1, 65], [1, 60]]
        items.sort(key = lambda items:[items[0], items[1]], reverse=True)
        dic = {}
        res = []
        for item in items:
            if item[0] in dic:
                if dic[item[0]] < 5:
                    dic[item[0]] += 1
                    res[-1][1] += item[1]
            else:
                dic[item[0]] = 1
                res.append(item)
        #res = [[2, 443], [1, 435]]; dic = {2: 5, 1: 5}

        for i in range(len(res)):
            res[i][1] = res[i][1] // 5 #res[i][1] = res[i][1] // dic[res[i][0]]
        #[[2, 88], [1, 87]]
        res.reverse()
        return res
```
