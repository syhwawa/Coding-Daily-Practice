Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.

```Python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        window_start = 0
        max_length = 0
        hashmap = {}

        for window_end in range(len(s)):
            if s[window_end] not in hashmap:
                hashmap[s[window_end]] = 1
            else:
                hashmap[s[window_end]] += 1

            while len(hashmap) > k:
                hashmap[s[window_start]] -= 1  
                if hashmap[s[window_start]] == 0:
                    del hashmap[s[window_start]] 
                window_start += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, (window_end - window_start +1))

        return max_length
  ```
