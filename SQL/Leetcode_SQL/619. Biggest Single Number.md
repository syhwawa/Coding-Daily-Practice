Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.
```

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select (Case when count(num)=1 then num Else null END) num
from my_numbers
group by num
Order by num DESC
limit 1
```
