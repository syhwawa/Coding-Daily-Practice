Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Id, Company, Salary FROM Employee 
WHERE ID IN (
SELECT e1.Id
from Employee as e1, Employee as e2
WHERE e1.Company = e2.Company
GROUP BY e1.id 
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN e1.salary >= e2.salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= COUNT(*)/2 
AND SUM(CASE WHEN e1.salary <= e2.salary THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) >= COUNT(*)/2 
)
GROUP BY Company, Salary
ORDER BY COMPANY
