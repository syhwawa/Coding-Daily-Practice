player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.

Write an SQL query that reports the first login date for each player.

The query result format is in the following example:

Table: Activity

Column Name	Type
player_id	int
device_id	int
event_date	date
games_played	int

Activity table:
```
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
```

Result table:
```
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
```

Write an SQL query that reports the first login date for each player.
511.Game Play Analysis I 
```
select player_id,min(event_date) as `first_login`
from Activity
group by player_id
```
Write a SQL query that reports the device that is first logged in for each player.

512.Game Play Analysis II

1. 对玩家分组，找出每个玩家的最早登录日期。
2. 再连接Activity表，筛选出每个玩家，最早登录日期时的设备
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select A.player_id, A. device_id 
FROM Activity A 
Join
(
    select b.player_id, min(b.event_date) as mindate
    from Activity as b 
    group by player_id) as c
on (a.player_id = c.player_id and a.event_date  = c.mindate)

```
