(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
Â 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

The query result format is in the following example:

Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+
```

```SQL
SELECT p1.product_id, ifnull(p2.new_price, 10) AS 'Price' 
FROM 
    (Select distinct(product_id)
    FROM Products) AS p1
left join 
    (Select product_id, new_price 
    FROM Products
    where (product_id, change_date) in (
        Select product_id, max(change_date)
        from Products
        where change_date <= '2019-08-16'
        group by product_id))
        as p2
on p1.product_id = p2.product_id
```
