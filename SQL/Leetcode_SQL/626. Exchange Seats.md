Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.

The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
 

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?
 
```
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
(CASE 
    WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND id = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SEAT) THEN id
    WHEN MOD(id, 2) = 1 THEN id + 1
    ELSE id - 1
    END) as id, student
    FROM SEAT
ORDER BY id
```
