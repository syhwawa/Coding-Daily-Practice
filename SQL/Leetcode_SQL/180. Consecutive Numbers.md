Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
```
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
```
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```


```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct l1.num as ConsecutiveNums 
from logs as l1
join logs as l2 on (l1.id = l2.id-1 and l1.num =l2.num)
join logs as l3 on (l2.id = l3.id-1 and l2.num =l3.num)
```
