Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Solution1:
```
select ifNull(
(select distinct salary
from Employee 
order by Salary Desc
limit 1,1),null
) as SecondHighestSalary;

```
Solution2:
```
select max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary from Employee 
where salary < (select max(salary) from Employee )
```
