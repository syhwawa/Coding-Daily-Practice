Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
```
+-------+---------+
| score | Rank    |
+-------+---------+
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 4.00  | 1       |
| 3.85  | 2       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.65  | 3       |
| 3.50  | 4       |
+-------+---------+
```

```SQL
Select
Score,
dense_rank () Over (
    order by Score DESC
) as 'Rank'
from Scores 
```

```SQL
select S1.Score,count(distinct S2.Score) as `Rank`
from Scores as S1 join Scores as S2 on (S1.Score <= S2.Score)
group by S1.Id
order by S1.Score desc;
```
