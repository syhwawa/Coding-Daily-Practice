Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    select distinct t1.Salary
    from Employee t1
    where N = (
        select count(distinct t2.Salary)
        from Employee t2
        where t2.Salary >= t1.Salary
    )
  );
END

```SQL
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    set N:= N-1;
  RETURN (
      select salary
      from Employee 
      group by salary
      order by salary DESC
      limit N, 1
);
END
